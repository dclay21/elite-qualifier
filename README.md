## Background

This is a required project as part of qualification for Code2College's Elite Program. Students chose one of three project options, with the chatbot project being selected here.

## Install
Runs on repl.it Python 3.8.2

Imported python libraries include:
 - random
 - pyowm (an OpenWeatherMap module)
 - pyjokes (a database of jokes)

## Usage

Running main.py will start a conversation, initally asking the user for a name. 

Sometimes, ConvoBot's question will end with a parenthetical statement. Please choose one of these options to continue the conversation. 
 - Ex: "Which of these sports do you like the most? (soccer, football, basketball, or volleyball?"
 - User response: soccer

When you'd like to stop talking, input "q" when asked a question.
